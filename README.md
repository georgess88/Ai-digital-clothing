# digital-clothing digital attire
This project is not yet completed.

I trained the model for picture classification using Google Teachable machine and a variety of clothing.
When you click on the image, the page will redirect you to a webgl developed using unity and C# to pick the best model that fit the image picked and a pose estimation using PoseNet will begin detecting your body part placement on the screen with the cloths applied.

The nicest aspect about this project is that it does not necessitate the use of a high-performance device.
